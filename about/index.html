        <p>Nordic Design.studio is run by me, <span class="highlight">Sara Ojasoo</span>.</p>

          <p>I help people and small businesses that have outgrown their DIY "okey it will work"-website to create a beautiful and functional website. </p>
          <p><a class="text-link" href="mailto:hello@nordicdesign.studio">Send me an email if you have a project you need help with!</a></p>

          <p>I am a Front End Developer and Web Designer. <br> I have a background in Journalism with a candidate exam in Journalism. I have worked for over ten years as a Subeditor and Newspaper Designer and Managing Subeditor at <a href="http://www.expressen.se" target=_"blank" >Expressen</a>, one of Swedens biggest newspapers.

          I am also a mum to a little 1,5 year old boy, a wife and a chocolate lover (who isn't?).</p>

          <p class="bolded">I was born in Sweden but when I met the man of my dreams we decided to really go for it and try and live the life of our dreams. One and a half year after we met; our son was born.</p>

          <p>In April 2017 we left our home countries and moved to the South of France. As a first time mum, with a little 6 month old boy, moving to a completely new country was overwhelming. House hunting on 3-4 hours of sleep and nappy changing in the middle of nowhere was a experience of a lifetime.</p>

          <p>But we did it. We found a house with a garden and a pool and we started working on settling in and building the life we dreamt of.</p>

          <p class="bolded">Working from home with my passion is a luxury – but it is doable! You CAN change your life. You CAN move, quit your job (or change it, I did!) and redo everything.</p>

          <ul class="about-ul">
            <li>What are your dreams?</li>
            <li>Who do you want to be?</li>
            <li>Where do you want to live?</li>
            <li>What do you want to do?</li>
          </ul>
          <br>
          <p>Now go do it. I'm here when you need me.</p>
